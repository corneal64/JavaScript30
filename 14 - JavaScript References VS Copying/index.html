      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const team2 = players.slice();
      console.log(team2);

      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in

      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",

      const coder = person;
      coder.age = 60;
      console.log("Person:", person);
      console.log("Coder:", coder);

      // how do we take a copy instead?

      console.log(paul);

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      // const captain = { ...person };

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
